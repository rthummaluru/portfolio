        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a Computer Science and Finance Graduate from Northeastern University.
            Right now my work centers around building scalabale systems and intelligent applications that bridge software engineering with real-world impact.
            This has allowed me to build a strong foundation in data engineering, full-stack development, and AI integration. 

            I've developed hands on experience across multiple stacks ranging from Python, SQL and cloud services (AWS, Databricks) to AI Agent frameworks and API's
            I'm especially interested in how AI can enhance automation, data workflows, and user experiences. My current focus is become a full stack AI Engineer capabale of designing end-to-end systems that learn, adapt, and deliver value.

            Beyond tech, I'm an avid runner (training for my first half marathon!), enjoy playing basketball, and love to travel, cook and play guitar to unwind.

            Ultimately, I'm driven by a simple goal: to build things that make a difference.

            Threadweaver: Work is scattered across Slack, Notion, and WhatsApp Business, forcing constant context-switching to stay updated. This unified AI assistant connects all three platforms into a single chat interface where you can search for information and take actions across your entire workspace. No more jumping between apps just ask and act. <br>
